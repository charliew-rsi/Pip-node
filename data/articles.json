When TypeScript was first released it received a mixed bag of reviews from JavaScript developers themselves. Some applauded the look and feel of writing in the language - TypeScript encourages strictly typed code and, while causing more overhead, provides more advanced debugging tools and generally makes Javascript feels more like the C-type languages and other similar languages. \\nThose that might be considered a bit more of a JavaScript purist did not receive TypeScript with quite the same fanfare. JavaScript in recent years has come more into its own and rejects many conventions of the C-type languages, often freeing the developer up to innovate more original design patterns. For these developers, the need to include TypeScript in their projects was clearly unneeded overhead.\\nWhen this author was questioned by a peer whether TypeScript was an option with React, it behooved this author to research a more educated opinion on the subject. This article explains the in-depth process of getting TypeScript properly configured in a React project. This is far from forgiving process and should not be considered lightly as an afterthought, and one should be very mindful about the dependencies running in their build. In spite of these drawbacks, one can confidently say that it is possible, though one should really question what they are hoping to gain from TypeScript before moving forward such an install. This article is a must-read before attempting this configuration oneself.","tags":["react","typescript"],"snippets":[],"uuid":"13bf2540-d16b-11e8-977d-f369df7a03e9"},{"url":"https://medium.com/@robinpokorny/index-as-a-key-is-an-anti-pattern-e0349aece318","slug":"6","createdAt":"2018-10-17T13:49:31.626Z","favoritesCount":0,"views":1,"author":{"username":"ck-RSI"},"title":"Index as a key is an anti-pattern","type":"Op-Ed","summary":"I recently ran across a line of code in React where the author write \"key={index}\".
